<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a senior computer science student at Texas A&M. I have taken upper level courses in microcomputer systems, artificial intelligence, reverse engineering, and software engineering. I am currently focusing my study on computer-human interaction and interactive information systems.</p>

<p>I have spent the last five years working as a developer for Engineering for Kids, a Virginia-based franchising company that provides engineering camps and classes for children. I have also spent the last two summers interning at Anadarko Petroleum Corporation in the Woodlands. My primary focus at both of these jobs has been to develop software that people interact with on a daily basis. At EFK, I developed the public facing website as well as the intranet site. At Anadarko, I was responsible for building a tool that served as a front-end to Informatica, a data transfer suite. </p>

<p>Because so much of my profession will rely on my ability to create usable software, I am interested in learning more about building web applications that effectively share information. I hope to unlearn all of my bad habits and develop new practical skills over the course of the semester.</p>

<h2>Assignment Submissions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="CSS-Layout-Project/index.html">CSS Layout</a>, Alternate <a href="CSS-Layout-Project/index-mine.html">with my exhibition</a><br><br>
    <p><strong>Limitations: </strong></P><P>I could not figure out the font used on the sidebar and in the headers, so this text does not line up perfectly.</p>
    <p>I also experienced differences in rendering at different display DPI scales, some elements may
    differ between displays of different densities. For example, the word "middle" in "Treasures of a Lost Art: Italian Manuscript Painting of the Middle Ages and Renaissance"
    may appear on different lines depending on display density. </p></li>

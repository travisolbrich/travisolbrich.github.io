Every decision has effects in the future and is connected to precedence. In Source Code, this is very true for the main character. Each time he re-experiences the whole eight minutes, Gyllenhaal's character does things based on the past and affecting the future. We the audience know that he will experience it all over again.</p><br><div class='img-center'> <img src='img/hanoi.png'  width='300px'> </div><br>  <p>Recursive algorithms are especially interesting for solving computer programs such as the  Tower of Hanoi shown above.

For example, someone asks Gyllenhaal \"Am I on the right track?\" He responds \"Same train, different track.\" His character realizes and comments on the fact that minor differences in actions in different timelines can lead to different outcomes. His actions in past timelines (tracks) got him to where he is now: he's on the same train but in a different timeline.</p>",
